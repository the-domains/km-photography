  We don't have the overheads that most businesses have as we conduct our
  business from home, keeping our prices extremely competitive. We order our
  replacement parts directly from wholesalers in Sydney and Melbourne with a
  maximum of 2 day delivery, that's if we don't have the required part in stock.
